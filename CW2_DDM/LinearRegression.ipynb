    "It is important to note that the above is a pedagogical example. In practical applications, you would not be well advised to implement your own linear regression. For one, this is reinventing the wheel. But perhaps even more importantly, the computational performance of our simple model is unlikely to be very good (i.e. it may take a long time to run on large datasets). In matlab, you can use the `fitlm` function to return a linear regression model. In Python, you can use Scikit-learn's `linear_model.LinearRegression()` model."

[^](#cite_ref-1) Formally, the loss function is the loss evaluated on a single data point (i.e. without the sum, or dividing by $N$) and the above is actually the \"cost function\". However, loss and cost are often used interchangeably, so with a minor abuse of notation to adopt the common practice in the literature, we'll call this loss."
